                <h4>Summary of AB Tests</h4>
                <p>
                  AB testing (also called split testing) is a method of
                  comparing two or more versions of a webpage, app feature, or
                  user experience to determine which performs better. By showing
                  different versions to similar groups of users and measuring
                  their behaviour, we can make data-driven decisions about what
                  changes actually improve our key metrics.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Why AB testing matters:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Removes guesswork</strong> - Instead of debating
                    opinions, we let user behaviour decide
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Reduces risk</strong> - Test changes before fully
                    committing resources
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Builds knowledge</strong> - Each test teaches us
                    something about our users
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Drives growth</strong> - Even small improvements
                    compound over time
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  <strong>The foundation of good testing:</strong> Every
                  experiment should solve a real problem or capitalise on a
                  genuine opportunity, backed by data and user insights.
                </p>

                <hr />

                <h4>Importance of Knowing Business and User Goals</h4>
                <p>
                  Before identifying problems to test, you need crystal clarity
                  on what success looks like for both your business and your
                  users.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Business goals to understand:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Primary KPIs your team is responsible for (conversion rate,
                    revenue, sign-ups, etc.)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Quarterly/annual targets and how experimentation supports
                    them
                  </li>
                  <li>Resource constraints and timelines</li>
                  <li>Risk tolerance for different types of changes</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>User goals to understand:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>What users are trying to accomplish on your site/app</li>
                  <li>Their pain points and frustrations</li>
                  <li>What motivates their decision-making</li>
                  <li>How they currently navigate your experience</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Why this alignment matters:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Ensures experiments address meaningful problems, not just
                    surface-level issues
                  </li>
                  <li>Helps prioritise which opportunities to test first</li>
                  <li>
                    Creates shared understanding across stakeholders about what
                    "winning" looks like
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Prevents testing changes that improve one metric whilst
                    harming another
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  <strong>Action step:</strong> Before identifying test
                  opportunities, document your primary business metric and 2-3
                  key user goals for the area you're optimising.
                </p>

                <h4>Large Experiments vs. Smaller Experiments</h4>
                <p>
                  One of the most strategic decisions in experimentation is
                  choosing the scope of your changes. This decision impacts
                  everything from development resources to how quickly you'll
                  get results.
                </p>

                <h5><strong>Large Experiments (Multiple Changes)</strong></h5>
                <p>
                  <strong>What they are:</strong> Testing significant changes
                  that involve multiple elements - full page redesigns, complete
                  flow overhauls, or major feature additions.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Faster to statistical significance</strong> - Bigger
                    changes typically create larger effect sizes
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Tests holistic experience</strong> - Captures how
                    multiple elements work together
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Higher potential impact</strong> - Can drive
                    meaningful business results more quickly
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Better for concept validation</strong> - Useful when
                    testing entirely new approaches
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Less granular learning</strong> - Can't isolate
                    which specific element drove the result
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Higher development cost</strong> - Requires more
                    time and resources to build
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Harder to iterate</strong> - If it fails, you don't
                    know what specifically to fix
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Higher risk</strong> - More moving parts mean more
                    potential failure points
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>When to choose large experiments:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    You have sufficient traffic to reach significance within a
                    reasonable timeframe
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    You're testing a fundamentally different approach or concept
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Development resources are available for bigger changes
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    You need to prove/disprove a major strategic direction
                  </li>
                  <li>Small iterative changes haven't moved the needle</li>
                </ul>

                <h5><strong>Smaller Experiments (Single Changes)</strong></h5>
                <p>
                  <strong>What they are:</strong> Testing focused changes to
                  individual elements - button text, colours, headlines, single
                  features, or specific copy changes.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Clear attribution</strong> - You know exactly what
                    worked or didn't work
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Easier to build upon</strong> - Learnings can be
                    systematically applied elsewhere
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Lower development cost</strong> - Quick to implement
                    and lower risk
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Easier iteration</strong> - Clear next steps based
                    on results
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Builds knowledge systematically</strong> - Creates a
                    library of what works for your users
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Slower to significance</strong> - Smaller effect
                    sizes require longer test durations or more traffic
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>May miss interaction effects</strong> - Elements
                    might work differently when combined
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Potentially lower impact</strong> - Individual
                    changes might not move business metrics meaningfully
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Can be incrementally slow</strong> - Building
                    meaningful change one small test at a time
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>When to choose smaller experiments:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    You have lower traffic volumes (smaller changes are more
                    realistic to detect)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    You're building systematic understanding of what drives
                    conversion
                  </li>
                  <li>Development resources are limited</li>
                  <li>
                    You're optimising an already well-performing experience
                  </li>
                  <li>You want to reduce risk and iterate quickly</li>
                </ul>

                <h5><strong>Decision Framework</strong></h5>
                <p>Ask yourself these questions to choose your approach:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Traffic volume:</strong> Can we realistically detect
                    small changes with our current traffic?
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Learning goals:</strong> Do we need to validate a
                    big concept or understand specific elements?
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Development capacity:</strong> What level of change
                    can we realistically build and maintain?
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Business urgency:</strong> Do we need results
                    quickly or can we build knowledge systematically?
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Risk tolerance:</strong> How comfortable are we with
                    bigger swings vs. safer iterations?
                  </li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                  <strong>Remember:</strong> Neither approach is inherently
                  better. The best choice depends on your specific situation,
                  goals, and constraints.

                <h4>Where Do Experiment Ideas Come From?</h4>
                <p>
                  Experiment ideas are the fuel for our optimisation efforts.
                  They can stem from various sources, each providing unique
                  insights into user behaviour, business needs, and potential
                  improvements.
                </p>

                <h5><strong>Data Analysis</strong></h5>
                <p>
                  Dive into quantitative data from tools like Google Analytics
                  or Contentsquare to uncover areas of friction, unexpected user
                  behaviour, or underperforming sections.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    High bounce rates on key pages (e.g., your homepage has a
                    52.8% bounce rate)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Low scroll rates (e.g., only 27.3% of users scroll below the
                    fold on your homepage)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Unexpected drop-offs in funnels (e.g., 14.9% conversion from
                    Home to Quote ARHI Welcome)
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  <strong>Actionable Questions:</strong> Where are users getting
                  stuck? What are they looking for but not finding? Are there
                  any significant deviations from expected user flows?
                </p>

                <h5><strong>User Research &amp; Feedback</strong></h5>
                <p>
                  Leverage qualitative insights to understand the "why" behind
                  user behaviour. This includes direct feedback and
                  observations.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>User interviews</li>
                  <li>Usability testing sessions</li>
                  <li>Customer support inquiries</li>
                  <li>Direct feedback forms and surveys</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  <strong>Actionable Questions:</strong> What are users
                  explicitly saying about their pain points or desires? What are
                  their unmet needs or confusions?
                </p>

                <h5><strong>UX/UI Audits &amp; Best Practices</strong></h5>
                <p>
                  Conduct an expert review of your current interface, comparing
                  it against established usability heuristics and industry best
                  practices.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Identifying cluttered layouts</li>
                  <li>Unclear calls-to-action</li>
                  <li>Inconsistent design elements</li>
                  <li>Non-responsive sections</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  <strong>Actionable Questions:</strong> Is our design intuitive
                  and easy to use? Are we following modern web standards?
                </p>

                <h5><strong>Competitive Analysis</strong></h5>
                <p>
                  Study what direct and indirect competitors are doing well (or
                  poorly) on their sites and in their user experiences.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Observing new features, design patterns, or messaging
                    strategies adopted by industry leaders
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  <strong>Actionable Questions:</strong> What competitive
                  advantages or disadvantages do we have in our user experience?
                  Are there successful patterns we could adapt or improve upon?
                </p>

                <h5>
                  <strong>Stakeholder Requests &amp; Business Goals</strong>
                </h5>
                <p>
                  Translate broader business objectives and specific requests
                  from internal teams (e.g., Marketing, Product, Sales) into
                  testable opportunities. Always dig deeper into vague requests
                  to ensure the problem or opportunity is clearly defined.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    A request to drive more sign-ups for a specific product
                  </li>
                  <li>To improve engagement with a new feature</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>How to refine stakeholder requests:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Stakeholder says: "Improve the homepage"</li>
                  <li>
                    You ask: "What specific outcome are we trying to achieve?
                    How will we measure success? What evidence suggests the
                    homepage needs improvement?"
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  <strong>Actionable Questions:</strong> What are the key
                  business metrics we need to move? Is the problem or
                  opportunity presented by the stakeholder clear and
                  quantifiable? What data supports this as a priority?
                </p>

                <h5><strong>Capturing and Managing Ideas</strong></h5>
                <p>
                  <strong>Documentation:</strong> Capture all ideas in a
                  centralised location (like an ideas board, Trello, or Jira)
                  with the source and supporting data. At our company, we use a
                  Microsoft Form for idea submissions and manage our experiment
                  backlog in Jira, but you could adapt this to any project
                  management tool (Asana, Notion, etc.).
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>Cross-validation:</strong> The strongest experiment
                  ideas often come from multiple sources pointing to the same
                  problem (e.g., data shows high bounce rate + user research
                  reveals confusion about value proposition).
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>Prioritisation:</strong> After identifying multiple
                  opportunities, consider both potential impact and
                  implementation effort to decide which to tackle first.
                </p>

                      <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> The best experiment ideas
                      combine quantitative data with qualitative insights. Start
                      with data to identify problems, then use research to
                      understand the "why" behind user behavior.

                <h4>Generate Ideas That Address Your Problem</h4>
                <p>
                  Once you've identified a clear problem or opportunity, it's
                  time to brainstorm potential solutions. The key is generating
                  diverse ideas that actually solve the user problem, not just
                  implementing changes for the sake of change.
                </p>

                <h5><strong>Basic Brainstorming Guidelines</strong></h5>

                <h6>
                  <strong>Focus on the Problem, Not Solutions You Like</strong>
                </h6>
                <p>Remember your "why":</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Always tie ideas back to the specific problem you identified
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Ask: "How does this solution address our users' pain point?"
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Avoid solutions based on personal preferences or what
                    competitors are doing
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h6><strong>Encourage Diverse Thinking</strong></h6>
                <p>Create the right environment:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Welcome all ideas, regardless of size or feasibility</li>
                  <li>
                    Don't dismiss ideas because "we tried that before" - context
                    and timing matter
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Build on others' suggestions rather than shutting them down
                  </li>
                  <li>Separate idea generation from idea evaluation</li>
                </ul>

                <h6><strong>Generate Multiple Options</strong></h6>
                <p>Don't stop at the first idea:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Aim for at least 5-10 different approaches to the same
                    problem
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Consider small tweaks (button text, colours) and larger
                    changes (layout redesigns)
                  </li>
                  <li>Think about different user scenarios and contexts</li>
                  <li>
                    Look for inspiration from other industries, not just direct
                    competitors
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h6><strong>Validate Ideas Against Your Problem</strong></h6>
                <p>Before moving forward, check:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Does this idea directly address the problem we identified?
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Can we create a clear hypothesis about why this would work?
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Will we be able to measure if this solution is successful?
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Is this solving a real user need or just our own
                    assumptions?
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h5><strong>Common Pitfalls to Avoid</strong></h5>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Assumption-based ideas:</strong> "Users will love
                    this because I do"
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Competitor copying:</strong> "Company X does this,
                    so we should too"
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Feature creep:</strong> "Let's test five changes at
                    once"
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Past bias:</strong> "We tried something similar
                    before and it didn't work"
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Shiny object syndrome:</strong> "This looks
                    modern/trendy"
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h5><strong>Moving from Ideas to Tests</strong></h5>
                <p>
                  Capture your ideas in a centralised location (ideas board,
                  document, etc.) with:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Brief description of the solution</li>
                  <li>Which problem it addresses</li>
                  <li>Rough feasibility (small, medium, large change)</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Prioritise based on:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Potential impact on your users and business metrics</li>
                  <li>Effort required to implement and test</li>
                  <li>Alignment with current business goals</li>
                  <li>Confidence level in your hypothesis</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  <strong>Next step:</strong> Once you have prioritised your
                  ideas, validate your current data to ensure you have accurate
                  baselines for testing.
